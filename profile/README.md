## ESO hydra pipelines

This organization contains repositories with methods and pipelines used for (pre)processing MRI data related to the ESO project. 
The organization should serve only for access to the pipelines that are used within the framework of Hydra, 
and primarily to those who do not have access to Hydra or NUDZ gitlab, but are part of the ESO project.

All of the repositories were cloned from the NUDZ gitlab page (mri-processing group) 11.11.2024 
and are therefore not automatically updated with every new change commited to the NUDZ gitlab.
